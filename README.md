# hear-and-say-in-english
Hear the word in the source language and utter it in the target language.

We use speech synthesis and speech recognition to allow children to practice autonomously their vocabulary.
No reading skills are necessary, so you can use this game also for children which are still illiterate.

The game is available at:
